<p>My name is Paul von Hagen, I’m a lifelong nerd and lover of all things tech. I’ve been working with computers since I was 4 years old when my brother taught me how to properly boot up DOS. I spent 4 years in the tech sector after college, took a break for a while to pursue another career, and am now looking to make my way back in through software engineering.</p>
